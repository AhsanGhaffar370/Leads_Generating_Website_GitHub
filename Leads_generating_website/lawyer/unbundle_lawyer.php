            <h5 class="text-dark font-weight-normal xs_texts">There are many reasons why offering unbundled services and other affordable options can play a critical role in positioning your firm to compete and thrive in today's very competitive legal market:

<br /><b>#1: More and more people are representing themselves</b>

Back in 1971, only 1% of litigants self-represented. Today, that number has grown to almost 67% of all filings in family court, and that rate is even higher in many regions. This means the pond most lawyers fish in has been reduced to barely 1/3 or 1/2 the size it once was.

This is largely due to two main factors:

    There is an increased use of forms and self-help information online
    Many people can no longer afford to pay $5000 up-front to retain a lawyer

For more detailed information and complete statistics - watch our webinar.

<br /><b>#2: Today, there are three times as many attorneys per person compared to 50 years ago</b>

For example, in 1963, the US had 10,000 law school graduates. By 2014, law school graduates totaled more than 45,000. This staggering increase means there are now three times more attorneys per person!

<br /><b>#3: Online form and doc prep software companies are charging 10-20% of the normal cost for services</b>

A simple Google search for "file for divorce" reveals an abundance of online software companies and "non-lawyer" document preparation services advertising rates that are a mere fraction of typical legal fees charged by an attorney.

These types of online services usually include very limited advice or review by an attorney, if at all. Nonetheless, they are lowering expectations for what many clients expect to pay for legal services.

        <h3 class="home_heading_settings  font-weight-bold heading">In Summary - More Competition for Fewer Clients</h3>
            <h5 class="text-dark font-weight-normal xs_texts">Adding it all up, there are now three times as many lawyers fishing along with dozens of price-slashing tech companies in a pond where there are only 1/3 to 1/2 of the fish as there used to be.

That is not a pretty picture...

So how do you succeed in such a competitive legal market?

            <h5 class="text-dark font-weight-normal xs_texts">By offering unbundled legal services you will be able to deliver services that fit the budget of the average North American working family. Those families represent two-thirds of our current legal marketplace that would otherwise be forced to self-represent.

Here are some examples of unbundled service options and pricing that attorneys from around the country have shared on our podcast:
